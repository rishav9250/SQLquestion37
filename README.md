What is the SQL query to display the current date?


CURRENT_DATE returns to the current date. This function returns the same value if it is executed more than once in a single statement, which means that the value is fixed, even if there is a long delay between fetching rows in a cursor.

Syntax:
CURRENT_DATE
     or
CURRENT DATE
